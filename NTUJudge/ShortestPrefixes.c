/**
 *	Shortest prefixes
 * 	A prefix of a string is a substring starting at
 *	 the beginning of the given string. The prefixes
 *	 of "carbon" are: "c", "ca", "car", "carb", "carbo"
 *	, and "carbon". Note that the empty string is not
 *	 considered a prefix in this problem, but every
 *	 non-empty string is considered to be a prefix of
 *	 itself. In everyday language, we tend to abbreviate
 *	 words by prefixes. For example, "carbohydrate" is
 *	 commonly abbreviated by "carb". In this problem,
 *	 given a set of words, you will find for each word
 *	 the shortest prefix that uniquely identifies the
 *	 word it represents. In the sample input below,
 *	 "carbohydrate" can be abbreviated to "carboh",
 *	 but it cannot be abbreviated to "carbo" (or
 *	 anything shorter) because there are other words
 *	 in the list that begin with "carbo". An exact
 *	 match will override a prefix match. For example,
 *	 the prefix "car" matches the given word "car"
 *	 exactly. Therefore, it is understood without 
 *	ambiguity that "car" is an abbreviation for "car"
 *	 , not for "carriage" or any of the other words in
 *	 the list that begins with "car".
