/**
 *	The longest common subsequence problem (LCS) 
 *	is finding the longest subsequence common to

 *	just two). It is a classic computer science
 *	 problem, the basis of diff, and has applications
 *	 in bioinformatics. Given a set of sequences,
 *	 output the length of the LCS of these sequences.
